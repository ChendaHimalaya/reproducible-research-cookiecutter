A simple template for python projects that can and should be dockerized. Created this repo since I more or less do the same procedure **every time** I create a new python API or dockerized repo. It includes pre-commit hooks cleaning up the code using `flake8`, `black` and `pre-commit`, and uses a `pre-push`-hook leveraging pytest for launching tests before every push.
