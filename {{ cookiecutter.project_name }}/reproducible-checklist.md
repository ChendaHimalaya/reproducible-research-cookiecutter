- [ ] It contains a Dockerfile that will automatically reproduce the experiments in the repository. If GPU:s were used, a Dockerfile that leverages these exist.
- [ ] Seed for randomizations of the initial experiments are documented in `RANDOM_SEEDS.md`.
- [ ] Links to the open data sources are referenced in the `README.md`.


## Additional quality-raising features
- [ ] A paper is referenced in the `README.md`, or a `METHODOLOGY.md` is attached in the repository.
- [ ] A link to a container registry to a Docker container in which the original experiments were performed is listed in the `README.md`.
